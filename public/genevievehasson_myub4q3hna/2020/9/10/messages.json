Definitely not the sexiest organ, hands down that award would go to you... multiple times. \n\nYou have an equestrian background? Now Iâm very intrigued. I do have a desire to see your naked body ride me, I only think about it at least twice a day... thatâs not too often is it? I think itâs often enough. \n\nUnfortunately I wasnât able to take care of it, I was late for my call. Which is unfortunate because I was thinking about you at the time, and it would have felt soooo good! Iâm glad youâre always willing to take care of me.

I feel the same about you.  Yes physical attraction is nice.  But the brain is really is a âsexy organ.â  Not the sexiest looking organ.....that goes to something else.\n\nYou really have a desire to be ridden.  Is it because of my equestrian background? Did you wake up hard and âtake careâ of it?  You know I will always be willing to take care of your needs...I woke up in a similar fashion to you.  \n\nSo you roll out of bed and work.  Fish noodles sounds gross!  I woke at 5:30.  Did some yoga and a quick run.

So I may not be the romantic poet as such, but Iâd still make the effort for you. \n\nYouâre most welcome darling, I love looking through your profile, it gives me a better idea of not just who you show the world you are, but also, how you think... you truly fascinate me. \n\nIâll remember that, so when weâre having a picnic somewhere on a beach, Iâll say âfuck meâ and make you ride me.  \n\nIâm glad you slept well, I woke up feeling hard, Iâd imagine you would have taken care of that for me.
